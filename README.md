# py-crypt
Simple encryption script based on the position of the char relatively to a juxtaposed alphabet (that can be shuffled with a given key), then transformed into a letter again.
The same algorithm is applied sepparately to numbers if users choses to do so.

PS : encryption similar to the Trithemius cipher
